## Q&A

### Q: Does the system currently detect model drift and trigger training if it drifts?

**A:** The system computes a drift score and a `needs_retrain` flag (for example in the `ml_monitoring_pipeline` DAG), and logs that it *would* trigger the `model_training_pipeline` when drift exceeds the 0.3 threshold. However, the actual trigger is currently a stub (logging only); it does not yet use `TriggerDagRunOperator` or otherwise automatically start retraining.

### Q: In realtime simulator mode, why can `--rps 100` over 60 seconds result in only ~15 transactions?

**A:** The realtime runner sends requests sequentially and each transaction waits for the `/predict` HTTP call (or its timeout) before sending the next one. If the configured `API_BASE_URL` points to a slow or unreachable service, each request can block for several seconds, so a 60-second wall-clock run might only complete a small number of transactions (e.g. ~15) even though the target RPS is 100.

### Q: In realtime simulator mode, are all transactions checked against the BentoML fraud/pricing endpoint?

**A:** Every generated transaction in realtime mode is posted to the configured `API_BASE_URL/predict` endpoint for fraud scoring, and the simulator falls back to a synthetic response only if the HTTP call fails. Dynamic pricing, however, is simulated locally inside the transaction generator and is not currently calling a separate BentoML pricing endpoint.
